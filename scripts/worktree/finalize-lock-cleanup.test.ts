/**
 * Tests for the finalize lock-release-on-exit contract.
 *
 * Reproduces the user-reported bug ("lock often stays in place on finalize
 * failure") and verifies the fix:
 *
 *   - The `process.on('exit')` handler installed by `installSignalHandlers`
 *     releases the lock on every termination path that goes through Node
 *     (process.exit, signal, unhandled throw).
 *   - SIGKILL (`kill -9`) bypasses every handler — that's documented in
 *     AGENTS.md as the `scripts/worktree/ abort` recovery path, not a unit
 *     test concern.
 *
 * Strategy: drive the real `finalize` entry point through a child process
 * running a self-contained fixture script. The fixture imports the same
 * helpers and calls the lock acquire/release path under three exit modes:
 *   1. `process.exit(1)` (the operator-error path that was leaking)
 *   2. Signal-triggered exit (`SIGUSR1`)
 *   3. Normal exit (the success path that was already correct)
 *
 * Each scenario verifies the lockfile is absent afterwards. The fixture
 * uses a per-test tmp directory and a unique lockfile name so concurrent
 * test runs do not collide.
