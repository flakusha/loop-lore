/**
 * Fixture for `finalize-lock-cleanup.test.ts`. Runs in a child process
 * so `process.exit` and signals really terminate it. Receives a tmp dir
 * and an exit mode as argv, exercises one of three paths through the
 * finalize lock machinery, then reports whether the lockfile still
 * exists at the moment of exit.
 *
 * We do NOT call the real `finalize()` entry point — that requires a
 * full worktree + GPG key + dev checkout, which is integration territory.
 * Instead we directly exercise `acquireFinalizeLock` and the
 * `process.on('exit')` cleanup contract that `installSignalHandlers`
 * sets up in production.
