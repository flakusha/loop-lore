/**
 * Tests for resolveDiffBase — the helper that decides which git ref to
 * hand to `bun run check --diff-base` during `worktree finalize` Step 2.
 *
 * Regression target: previously finalize passed the live target branch
 * (e.g. `dev`) as the diff-base. When the target had moved past the
 * finalizing branch's base, the scoped diff included files the branch
 * never touched — and the coverage gate applied its 80% floor to those
 * unrelated modules. Fix: pass the merge-base so the diff is exactly
 * the branch's own contribution since forking from the target.
 *
 * Setup strategy: build a real tiny git history with a shared base
 * commit, then advance one branch (the "target") past the base while
 * leaving the "HEAD" branch untouched. Asserting on the resolved ref
 * proves the helper picks the stable ancestor instead of the moving
 * target. The fixture runs against /tmp/ so it cannot affect the
 * real repo.
